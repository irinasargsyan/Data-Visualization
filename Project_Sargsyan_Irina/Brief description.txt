For this project, which was aimed at creating a dash, we used the data that you can find in the "olympic" zip file. 
The data was taken from the Kaggle. You can find it in the following link: 
https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results
The dataset includes data concerning Winter and Summer Olympic Games from the year 1896 to 2016. 
So, it doesn't include only Winter Games of 2018 and 2020, the latter as we know didn't take place because of the pandemic.
The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns.
The description of the column features you can find in the link provided above.
In folder "assets" you can find the images that were used in our dash.
In order to get access to the dash use Project.py file.
